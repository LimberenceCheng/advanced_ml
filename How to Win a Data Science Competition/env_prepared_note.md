# What Python Module Should I Use?

- Numpy. It's a linear algebra library, provides the most convenient way to perform matrix multiplication?


- Pandas. This one is about data reading/processing.
- SkLearn. This one is about ML algorithms.
- XGBoost. This one is about GBDT.
- LightGBM. This is supported by Microsoft, DMTK. It is also about GBDT(but faster then XGBoost)


- Matplotlib. This one is about visualizations.
- tsne. This one is about dimensionality reduction.

### Modules deal with Deep Learning

- PyTorch. 
- CNTK. (Provided by Microsoft)
- TensorFlow. (Most popular, provided by Google)
- Caffe/Caffe2
- Keras. (Based on theano, tensorflow, CNTK, it is easier to build the neural networks)
- Tensorlayer(Kind of like Keras, it's aim is to build neural network easier and faster, but its logic is better then Keras)
